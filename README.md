- Ready for integration with AI or data analysis tools  
- Simple and easy-to-understand structure for further development  

## Machine Learning Usage

This project integrates several machine learning components for enhanced stock analysis:

- **Sentiment Analysis:** Uses a pretrained FinBERT transformer model to analyze financial news headlines and classify their sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral).  
- **Stock Price Forecasting:** Implements Facebook's Prophet model to forecast future stock prices based on historical data, providing estimated accuracy using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).  
- **Performance Metrics:** Calculates and displays forecasting accuracy to help users understand model reliability.

These ML features provide insights beyond raw stock data by incorporating natural language processing and time series forecasting.
